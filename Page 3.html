	So, where do I stand in this premise surrounding the computer revolution? Personally,
	I can confidently say that the computer revolution and its continuous development 
	throughout my lifetime has benefited society as a whole. Despite the numerous arguments
	that negatively downplay how computers in the future changed society for the worse, there
	are always solutions to fix the main issues in the first place using computers and common
	sense. Can't find a job because computers took over? Why not work in the computer industry? 
	If it isn't your interest, then start a new business that isn't ridiculed by computers and it 
	might create an economic boom for yourself. Computers became complex to learn? Sure, computers 
	back then had limited functionality and systems that made then simple to learn and understand. 
	Nowadays, learning multiple programming languages is an essential skill to get into the technological 
	industry. Computers created a horrible lifestyle? Take some responsibiity and control to balance your 
	computer usage times and your personal life. I honestly don't see any problems when computers revolutionized
	the past and future.

	Does that mean that I'm correct and all of this resarch done means nothing? Definitely not. First,
	this was my personal opinion, meaning that you don't have to agree with what I'm saying. Second, gathering
	different viewpoints is a great way to picture out a debatable situation. In the case of this topic, sometimes
	the obvious answer isn't the true answer. The impacts the computer revolution made on society is dependent on
	a person's current position in society. People range from being young to old, or from being economically poor to
	rich. This also includes people's experiences with computers, whether they've been previously a contributor to the
	revolution or not, there is bias. But, by placing down the information, what do you think about the computer
	revolution's impact on society?
