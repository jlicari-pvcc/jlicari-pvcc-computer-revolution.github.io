<p style="color: #55FF00; line-height: 25px; text-indent: 25px">
	The computer revolution made its impact back in the 1960s, 
	and the decades after the revolution have significantly shaped 
	society. However, how did the computer revolution change society 
	as a whole? Some people have opinions that the computer revolution 
	completely changed for the better, while others say that the 
	computer revolution didn't make society better. Others say that 
	the computer revolution's impact created a balanced society due to 
	the weights of positives and negatives from the revolution, or 
	people's opinions on the revolution changed depending on where they 
	are in society. Some people focused on the past when the revolution 
	happened and when it was great, while others focused on the future 
	and its great technological growth. Where does society stand now 
	after all the decades of computer changes? That is what I am going
	to answer here.

<p style="color: #55FF00; line-height: 25px; text-indent: 25px">
	Also, a quick note from the information of sources used to present
	opinions, the computer revolution is centered around the dramatic 
	development of computers and its impact towards society. What this
	means is that this revolution also affects the future of technology
	as a whole. Therefore, the mention of technology in society will be
	made, but only in the leading future and not at the start of the
	computer revolution.
