<p style="color: #55FF00; line-height: 25px; text-indent: 25px">
	Given the question encompassing whether the computer revolution made its
	impact positively towards society, the most obvious answer would be "yes."
	Anybody would be right to answer in that sense; however, there are more
	deeper connections about this topic through what made society better or
	worse which people haven't had made much thought about.
</p><br>

<p style="color: #55FF00; line-height: 25px; text-indent: 25px">
	Let's start off with the common knowledge people know about the positives of the
	computer revolution. We already know society became better because of the massive
	convenience and efficiency from computers, it saves time and energy to produce
	data within large amounts. For example, everyday people use computer software
	applications like spreadsheets or documents to organize information, it became
	streamlined into many jobs and businesses. Next, we know that society became
	better through various methods of communication, no matter how far the sender
	is from the receiver. The computer revolution shortly later developed emails,
	and then years later developed social media. Collaboration between people became
	possible through video conferences as the development of computers continued over
	the years. That's not all, the computer revolution made its contributions towards
	education and scientific research. In fact, there was a 1999 survey done at DePauw
	University by Dennis A. Trinkle that supports the fact that many college students
	and professors use computers to learn, research, and teach their subject content
	(in the case of the survey, it was specifically towards history). The list goes on, 
	but the main point here is that the computer revolution had made an overarching domino 
	effect on society over many decades, and the mass majority of the public sides in 
	agreement that the benefits outweigh the costs.

	Now, what do I mean by the costs? Despite the overwhemling positives the computer
	revolution as brought upon people, there are others who think that the revolution has
	negatively impacted society in the future. Not a mistake in any means, but a mistreatment of
	computer usage by despicable people called criminals. Computers in the future become suspectible
	to cybersecurity risks, meaning information could be easily obtained to those who are knowledgeable
	to hacking into computer systems. Aside from the criminal activities they bring to computers,
	there are hidden negative impacts that hurts towards society. Due to the automation of computers 
	since the revolution, many industry jobs are overtaken by computers (not to be confused with the 
	reigning terror of artifical intelligence we have today) for faster efficiency that a typical 
	human cannot handle like information or data. Another thing that has negatively impacted society 
	is how computers has possession of people's daily lives, causing mental addiction to the screen and 
	creating poor physical health. The list also goes on, but the main point here is that the computer 
	revolution's slow growth and attention affected the future of society negatively, and a small
	majority of the public has compelling arguments that people's unmoral actions through computers made
	it outweigh the benefits.

<p style="color: #55FF00; line-height: 25px; text-indent: 25px">
	Laying out both sides of the argument, there are those who think that the computer 
	revolution's impact had nothing for society due to the balancing positives and negatives
	the revolution brought. If the computer revolution did nothing to society, does that mean 
	that the revolution hasn't happened yet? Alan C. Kay in 1997 made a talk about how the the
	computer revolution is still developing improvements and adding features for computers 
	for the next oncoming future. He makes a few key points that computers are shrinking in 
	size capacity, the architecture of the computer changes, the programming languages of the 
	computer are advancing, and the computers are expanding their potential to the next level.
	While may these sound like they're beneficial for the long-run, the problem arises that 
	programmers would have to adapt to these new challenges, the overall complexity of the 
	computer system is getting harder to comprehend. Because of this, there is sort of "arms
	race" between the development of the computer and the programmer to create programs that leads
	the computer revolution to not happen yet. The fullest potential hasn't been met yet, and it
	continues to be true through the development of artifical intelligence that people are studying
	today. The computer revolution is making its impact on society gradually better while simultaneously 
	making society worse, and that is where the balance between the revolution's positives and
	negatives comes from.
